This is the official keyboard for Key Mapper that has a GUI (Graphical User Interface). i.e on-screen buttons!

Key Mapper GUI Keyboard is a fork of OpenBoard, which is a 100% foss keyboard based on AOSP. The keyboard built in to Key Mapper is called the "Basic Input Method" and does NOT have a GUI.
